<h2>Block Sodoku</h2>
		<p>This project simulated user mouse input on a desktop to attempt to reach the highscore in a puzzle game called Block Sodoku. The script recreates all the rules to the game (a mashup game between sodoku and tetris), and runs a simulation of each of the three of the randomly given pieces before deciding on and enacting the next best move.</p>
	<h3>Tools and libraries used:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><code>numpy</code> to model the state of the board.</li>
		<li>the <code>pyautogui</code> library for reading screenshots and manipulating the mouse.</li>
		<li><code>matplotlib</code> for plotting the score as I optimized the stategies.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>things I learned:</h3>
		This was one of the first projects I finished after learning the syntax and reasoning for defining my own classes and using OOP to handle complexity. 
	<h3>code:</h3>
		https://github.com/topherclay/BlockSodoku
	<h3>example:</h3>

<h2>Wordle Results Database and Chatbot</h2>
		<p>This script runs a chatbot that sits in a Discord chat channel and parses messages posted in that channnel to determine if they are copy-pasted Wordle results. It takes those results and updates a mysql database which can then be queried by the users with a collection of chatbot commands to compare their Wordle statistics.</p>
	<h3>Tools and libraries used:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>a small mysql database hosted on the same machine as the script.</li>
		<li>the SQLAlchemy library as the ORM between the chatbot and the database</li>
		<li>discord.py to handle the chatbot and the Discord API</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>things I learned:</h3>
		This project gave me a much better understanding of SQL and also of the proper ways to handle the async interactions between a database and a chatbot.

<h2>image splitter</h2>
		<p>This script takes an image and tries to find the best line for dividing that image into two regions where the two regions have the largest possible difference in color. This effectively results in the most natural "horizon" of any given image, where in the case of an actual landscape photo the best line is the actual horizon.</p>
	<h3>Tools and libraries used:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>opencv-python for the image parsing.</li>
		<li>CIELAB colorspace to determine distance between colors and most closely percieved by human vision.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>things I learned:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>How to optimize for working with visual media on an interpretted language.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>examples:</h3>

<h2>family average location</h2>
		<p>This script parses a .cvs file of names and gps locations and then finds the average location that is roughly in the center of those names as interpretted by the WGS 84 geodesic standard.</p> 
	<h3>Tools and libraries used:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>the pygeodesy library for manipulating GIS data.</li>
		<li>the folium library for the openstreet map visualizations.</li>  
	</ul>
	<h3>things I learned:</h3>
		Even though python is not a front end language, I learned that I could still leverage some simple javascript wrapper libraries to get a lot of easy data visualization in a web browser. 
	<h3>code:</h3>
		https://github.com/topherclay/family_average_location

<h2>raspberrypi motion activated camera.</h2>
		<p>For this project I wrote a script to read from a usb camera connected to a raspberry pi. The script controlled how often to use the camera, only leaving it on to record when motion was detected. This allowed me to point the camera out of my living room window and log the individual events where people or cars crossed in front of my front yard.</p>
	<h3>Tools and libraries used:</h3>
		<ul><li>This project used the OpenCV python library to interact with the camera output.</li>
		<li>A raspberry pi connected to a usb camera.</li></ul>
	<h3>things I learned:</h3>
		<ul><li>memory management on a limited system.</li> 
		<li>How to use the OpenCV library with video.</li>
		<li>a fun motion detection algorithm.</li></ul>
	<h3>example:</h3>

<h2>Lyrics searcher</h2>al
		<p>This project uses a regex string input to search a musicians discography and output all the albums, tracks, and surrounding lines that match the expression, organizing them into a .cvs so that you can track any reoccuring lyrical motifs across an artists career.</p>
	<h3>Tools and libraries used:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>regex, via the <code>re</code> standard library for the pattern matching</li>
		<li>the <code>Pandas</code> library for modelling the data before exporting to .cvs</li>
		<li>the <code>BeautifulSoup</code> library along with Requests for webscraping the lyrics.</li>
		</ul>
	<h3>things I learned:</h3>
		This was my first project using automated http GET requests so this is where I learned proper ettiquette for multipage webscraping. This is also where I first really made use of regex.

<h2>laptop wifi wardriving</h2>
		<p>I used a wifi adapter dongle to track IEEE 802.11 data between nearby cellphones and wifi devices.</p>
	<h3>Tools and libraries used:</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>WireShark.</li></ul>
	<h3>things I learned:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>How to read WireShark capture logs.</li>
		<li>This project helped me get familiar with the OSI model as I was paying much closer attention to both the network and the transport layers.</li> </ul>
